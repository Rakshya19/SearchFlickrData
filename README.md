# SearchFlickrData
Get data from flickr API and display.  
The tags textbox can take multiple tags in comma separated form. 
On page load data is diaplayed from different API. Latest photos that are public are displayed on page load. 
When tag is searched, data is loaded from different API, so total count is different on page load and search button click. 
Cone the repository and open in webstrom as I have worked in webstrom. 
Open in webstrom and run the index.html page in chrome. 
HAPPY CODING
